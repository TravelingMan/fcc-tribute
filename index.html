      <h4 class="media-heading">Rear Admiral Grace Hopper</h4>
      <p>A military leader, computer scientist, and pioneer of technology. Her efforts to advance computation took
        her in directions that many other experts at the time said were uninteresting or outright impossible,
        such as using computers for anything
        other than mathematical calculations.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>I had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. â€¦ they carefully told me, computers could only do
          arithmetic; they could not do programs.</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>When she retired (for the second and final time) from the service, she was the oldest person in the Navy.
        Her retirement ceremony was held on the most ancient ship in the Navy, the <em>U.S.S. Constitution</em>
        -- a 188 year old warship.</p>
